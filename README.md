# Tagline
Doom but you only have one gun because weâ€™re college students.

# Mechanics
## Minimum Viable Product
### Movement
- [ ] Walking on a flat plane
- [ ] Can look left to right
- [ ] Up and down only at a certain angle (70 degrees for now)
### Shooting
- [ ] Probably shoot projectiles since enemies should use projectiles anyway, but I would prefer a hitscan weapon if we can figure out how to do it.
### 1 Enemy
- [ ] Start with just a box
- [ ] That or we see about drawing a 2d sprite
- [ ] Really anything to avoid modeling
### 1 Level
- [ ] Start with just an empty room, add complexity later
### Taking damage
- [ ] Health bar
### Main Menu
- [ ] Instructions on screen
- [ ] Health at top
